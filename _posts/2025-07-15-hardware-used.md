# How to Start: A Quick Guide

A homelab is your personal tech playgroundâ€”a place to learn, experiment, and host your own services. Getting started is easier than you think. You don't need a server rack; you can begin with the computer you already own.

Let's look at a few starting points, and then I'll share the path I took.

## Simple & Low-Cost Starting Points

### Option 1: VirtualBox or Hyper-V

The easiest way to start is on your main desktop or laptop.

*   **VirtualBox:** This free software lets you run "virtual machines" (VMs) on any operating system. It's perfect for learning the basics of Linux or testing software in a safe, sandboxed environment.
*   **Hyper-V:** If you have Windows 10/11 Pro, you already have a powerful, built-in hypervisor. It's a great way to learn skills that are directly applicable to corporate IT.

**The catch?** Your lab's performance is tied to your PC. It's not ideal for services you need running 24/7.

### Option 2: The Raspberry Pi

This credit-card-sized computer is a homelab classic for a reason. It's tiny, silent, and sips power, making it perfect for dedicated, always-on services. A Pi is the ideal host for projects like **Pi-hole** (network-wide ad-blocking) or **Home Assistant** (smart home automation). Its main limitation is its low processing power.

## My Path: A Dedicated Two-Server Setup

After I tried the Hyper-V option above, I wanted more power and reliability. My philosophy became: **separate compute from storage**. This led me to a setup with two dedicated machines.

_My actual hardware_

### Machine 1: The Compute Brain (Proxmox)

I purchased a second-hand HP mini pc and I installed  **Proxmox VE** on it. Proxmox is a free, powerful, open-source hypervisor that turns a computer into a dedicated host for VMs and LXCs. This machine runs all my apps and services: Docker, firewall, proxies, test environments, and more. I can also do some automations using proxmox API, which is great!

The exact model that I choose is *HP EliteDesk 800 G6*. Why? Because it is a small box and it has some pretty powerfull hardware components:

| Processor                                | Memory           | Storage     |
| :--------------------------------------- | :--------------- | ----------: |
| Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10500T CPU          | 32GB DDR4        | 1.5 TB NVMe |

This model also supports 10Gb/s network card as a module and I really like that. Maybe I will add such NIC in the future.

I think this is a decent virtualization node that I can use to test docker, k8s, proxies and so on.


### Machine 2: The Data Guardian (TrueNAS)

For this one, I can say that I got lucky ðŸ˜‚.

One of my friends just donated me a old laptop that he didn't really use anymore.

This is a *Alienware M17x R2 legacy* back from 2009.

I installed **TrueNAS SCALE** on it, an open-source Network Attached Storage (NAS) operating system. Its killer feature is the **ZFS filesystem**, which provides incredible protection against data corruption. It serves files to my entire network and, most importantly, stores the backup for my Proxmox VMs under a *Proxmox Backup Server* instance.

| Processor                                | Memory           | Storage            |
| :--------------------------------------- | :--------------- | -----------------: |
| Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q9000        | 8GB DDR3         | 1 x 500GB SATA SSD |
|                                          |                  | 1 x 500GB SATA HDD |

I use a USB drive as boot device, just to benefit from both drives capacity, since TrueNAS will reserve all the space from the boot drive, thus making it unaccessable.

This two-system approach means my applications run fast on one machine, while my critical data is kept safe on another.


## Your Journey Starts Now

There is no single "right" way to build a homelab. This is how I did it.

I will post new topics about:
- how I did soma automations using Packer & Terraform
- how I setup a Docker machine
- how I plan to develop a k8s cluster

Stay tuned for more! ðŸ˜Ž
