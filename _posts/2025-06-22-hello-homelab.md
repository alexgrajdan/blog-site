# Welcome

Hello and welcome to my homelab docs site!

![img-description](/assets/img/hello-homelab/welcome_post.webp){: w="500" h="500" }


This blog is dedicated to documenting my journey in building, maintaining, and experimenting with my personal homelab. Here, you'll find guides, hardware reviews, troubleshooting notes, and project updates as I explore the world of self-hosted services, networking, and server hardware.

## What is a Homelab?

A homelab is a personal environment where you can experiment with servers, networking, virtualization, and various IT technologies at home. It's a great way to learn, test new ideas, and gain hands-on experience outside of a production environment.

## What to Expect

- **Hardware Reviews:** Insights and reviews on servers, networking gear, and other homelab essentials.
- **Setup Guides:** Step-by-step instructions for configuring services, operating systems, and network setups.
- **Project Logs:** Updates on ongoing and completed projects, including challenges and solutions.
- **Tips & Tricks:** Useful commands, scripts, and best practices for homelab enthusiasts.

## Why I Started This Blog

I created this site to share my experiences, help others avoid common pitfalls, and connect with fellow homelabbers. Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience, I hope you'll find something useful here.

Stay tuned for more posts and feel free to reach out with questions or suggestions!
