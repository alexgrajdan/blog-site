After reboot, open Windows Terminal and run
```powershell
wsl --list --verbose
```
You should see your installed Linux distro with version 2.

#### Optional: Install a Different Linux Distro
To view available distros:

```powershell
wsl --list --online
```
To install a specific distro (e.g., Debian):

```powershell
wsl --install -d Debian
```

### Install VSCode
Follow these steps to install VS Code, a lightweight and powerful source code editor for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- Go to the official download page: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

Click on Windows > User Installer (or System Installer if you prefer system-wide installation).

- Launch the downloaded `.exe` file.

Follow the setup wizard:

Accept the license agreement, choose the installation location, check the following options:
- Add to `PATH`
- Register Code as an editor for supported file types
- Add `Open with Code` to context menu

Click `Install` and wait for the process to complete.

- Launch VS Code

After installation, VS Code will launch automatically.
You can also open it anytime by searching for "Visual Studio Code" in the Start menu.


### Configure GIT on WSL
- Open Windows Terminal, then select your Linux distro (e.g., Ubuntu) from the dropdown.

- Run the following command to install Git:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
git --version
```

#### Configure Git

Set your global Git username and email:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@your_email.com"
```
Optional: Set your preferred editor (e.g. VS Code):
```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```
#### Set Up SSH Keys

Generate a new SSH key:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@your_email.com"
```
Press Enter to accept the default file location and optionally set a passphrase.

#### Import public key
Copy your public key to your clipboard:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

You can paste the content into SSH keys from either Github or other platform you are using: e.g. Gitlab, Bitbucket etc.

### (Optional) Install SSH agent

{: .prompt-tip }
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

- Step 1: Install Keychain

Update your package list and install keychain:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install keychain -y
```
- Step 2: Configure Your Shell to Use Keychain and SSH Agent

Edit your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`) and add the following lines at the end:
```bash
# Start ssh-agent and load keys using keychain
eval $(keychain --eval --quiet ~/.ssh/id_ed25519)
```
If you want you can check for more info on [auto-launching SSH agent (GitHub Docs)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases#auto-launching-ssh-agent-on-git-for-windows)

- Step 3: Reload Your Shell Configuration

Apply the changes by running:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
Or restart your terminal session.

- Step 4: Add Your SSH Key to Keychain

The first time you start a new terminal session, you’ll be prompted for your SSH key passphrase. Keychain will cache it for future sessions:
```bash
keychain id_ed25519
```
- Step 5: Verify SSH Agent is Running

Check that your key is loaded:
```bash
ssh-add -l
```
You should see your key listed.


### Installing Gpg4win with Kleopatra via Winget

#### What is Gpg4win?

Gpg4win is a Windows suite for secure file and email encryption using OpenPGP and S/MIME. It includes:

1. GnuPG – the core encryption engine
2. Kleopatra – graphical certificate manager
3. GpgOL – Outlook plugin
4. GpgEX – Windows Explorer integration

- Step 1: Open Windows Terminal or PowerShell

Press `Win + X` and choose Windows Terminal or PowerShell.

### Install Gpg4win using winget

Run the following command:
```powershell
winget install -e GnuPG.Gpg4win
```
`-e` ensures an exact match to avoid ambiguity.

Winget will download and install the latest version of Gpg4win, including Kleopatra.

#### Launch Kleopatra

After installation:

Press Win and search for `Kleopatra`. Click to launch the application.

#### Create a Key Pair

To create a new key pair in Kleopatra:

1. go to `File` → `New OpenPGP key pair`
2. Enter your name and email.
3. Set a strong passphrase.
4. Complete the wizard to generate your key.

#### Verify Installation

You can verify that Gpg4win is installed and working:
- Open Kleopatra and check for your key.
- Reload you PowerShell terminal.
- Run this in PowerShell to check GPG version:

```powershell
gpg --version
```

### Configure GPG key to Git & WSL

#### Export the Key for WSL2
- In Kleopatra, right-click your certificate from the list displayed and choose `Export`.
- Save the file as something like `gpg-public.asc` in a known location (e.g. `Documents`).
- Export the private key by right-clicking and choosing "Backup Secret Keys", saving it as `gpg-private.asc`.

<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

> Please note: If you set a `passphrase`, when exporting the private key, you will be prompted to provide that `passphrase`. Also, if you see you gpg private key at `0 KB`, you may need to wait few minutes until decryption is completed or to re-export it once again.

<!-- markdownlint-restore -->



#### Import the Key into WSL2
Open your WSL2 terminal.

Navigate to the folder where the key is saved (e.g., /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/Documents/):

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/Documents/
```
Import the private key:
```bash
gpg --import gpg-private.asc
```
Import the public key:
```bash
gpg --import gpg-public.asc
```
Verify if the key can be displayed from WSL:
```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
```

> Note: you may see this warning message `gpg: conversion from 'utf-8' to 'CP437' failed: Illegal byte sequence`, it can be ignored.
{: .prompt-info }

<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

Your output should look something like:
```bash
sec   ed25519/ABCDEF1234567890 2025-05-24 [SC]
      ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12
uid           [ultimate] YOUR NAME <your.email@your_email.com>
```


<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
> Note: the key ID is after `ed25519/` (e.g., `ABCDEF1234567890`).
{: .prompt-info }
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

#### Troubleshooting: `Unknown` Trust Level in GPG

<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
> If you see `[unknown]` at the trust level, like this:
>```bash
> uid           [unknown] YOUR NAME <your.email@your_email.com>
>```
>Follow these steps to fix it:
{: .prompt-warning  }
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

**1. Edit the GPG key in WSL**

You can use either your email or the key ID:
```bash
# Using your email
gpg --edit-key your.email@your_email.com

# Or using the key ID
gpg --edit-key ABCDEF1234567890
```

**2. Set the trust level**

At the `gpg>` prompt, type:
```bash
gpg> trust
```
GPG will ask how much you trust this key. Since you generated it, choose the highest trust level:

```text
Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5
```
Type `5` (ultimate trust), then confirm with `y` and quit with `q`.

<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
> In Kleopatra, you can also set trust by double-clicking your certificate and adjusting trust settings in the UI.
{: .prompt-tip  }
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

### Configure Git with the new GPG key

Copy the key ID from your gpg key and configure git yo use this key:
```bash
# Replace "ABCDEF1234567890" with your key ID
git config --global user.signingkey ABCDEF1234567890
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```
### Configure WSL 

Create a file called `.gpg-setup.sh` in the home folder of your wsl user and add those lines:
```bash
# Set GPG_TTY for the current terminal
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
 
# Launch the GPG agent if not already running
gpgconf --launch gpg-agent
```

Add this code to your `~/.bashrc` file:
```bash
# Set gpg TTY and launch gpg-agent
source ~/.gpg-setup.sh
```

Close or reload your terminal
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
Create a gpg configuration file `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`{: .filepath}.

Add this line into the file
```bash
pinentry-program "/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Gpg4win/bin/pinentry.exe"
```

Kill the gpg process that it running (it will restart automatically at the next gpg action needed)
```bash
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
```
### Add the Public Key to Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket
Export your public key from WSL2:
```bash
gpg --armor --export you@your_email.com
```
Copy the entire output (including `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- and -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`)

Go to your provider (Github, Gitlab, etc) and click "Add key" under GPG keys.

Paste the public key and save.
